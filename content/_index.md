<h1>Osman Khan's Story<h1>
</div> 



On January 15, 2022, the life of Osman Khan and the members of the Khan-Valdes family changed
forever. Osman Khan, a 24 year old U.S. citizen, was apprehended at the border of Venezuela and
held hostage due to his American nationality. His family was then extorted on January 17th, when they first found out that Osman was in danger, and asked to give upwards of a thousand dollars in exchange for his release. Even after sending money, they lost contact with Osman.

On January 20, Osman was allegedly supposed to be presented in
court but was instead taken to what they call the “House of Torture.” At this location, Osman was tortured and treated inhumanely. He was water-boarded, starved, and electrocuted until unconscious. The methods of torture were so severe, medical attention
was required to bring Osman back and revive him. Osman was then transferred to the DGCIM
prison where he has to face the people who tortured him on a daily basis. On multiple occasions, Osman has been placed inside an
enclosure known as “El Tigrito”, a cell so tight, he only has enough room to stand straight up. Such a tight space over prolonged periods has caused hysteria, hallucination, and delusion. In the prison, Osman has been suffering from seizures, likely due to his torture, and has
been transported via ambulance for medical attention various times. He is being forcefully injected and given unknown treatments against his will. These crimes against humanity cannot go unnoticed!

We need to
raise our voices, shed light on what is going on, and fight to free our American prisoners arrested
abroad, precisely in Venezuela where this seems to be an ongoing trend.
Osman Khan is one of the youngest, if not the youngest, American prisoner in the world. He had just
graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in finance and real estate in May of 2021.
He is a family-oriented young man who did everything to help those around him. He is a man of
integrity and always does the right thing. Osman suffers from extreme panic attacks and anxiety, making
this situation exacerbate such symptoms. Osman, an innocent young man, is being held on charges of
conspiracy and will not be released unless the US government acts. We understand that Biden has a deal that can bring Osman and other wrongul detainees in Venezuela home. 

Lets put pressure and get the word
out to #BringOsmanHome and get Biden to act!!!!!
