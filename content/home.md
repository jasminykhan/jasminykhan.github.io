On January 15, 2022 the life of Osman Khan and the members of the Khan-Valdes family changed
drastically. Osman Khan, a 24 year old U.S. citizen, was apprehended at the border of Venezuela and
held hostage due to his nationality. On January 20, Osman was allegedly supposed to be presented in
court but was instead taken to what they call the “House of Torture.” 

At this location, Osman was tortured and treated inhumanely. He was water-boarded, starved for five days, threatened to be raped by the
guards, and electrocuted until unconscious. The methods of torture were so severe, medical attention
was required to bring Osman back and revive him. After this, Osman was transferred to the DGCIM
prison where he has to face the people who tortured him on a daily basis, and where he has also been
tortured psychologically and physically. In multiple occasions, Osman has been placed inside an
enclosure known as “El Tigrito” which is big enough to only stand and is left there to spend his days in
the dark and sleep while also standing. In the prison, Osman has been suffering from seizures and has
been transported via ambulance for medical attention. Osman is now experiencing trouble with the
function of his legs, primarily his left leg, which we suspect is due to the torture he underwent. 

It has
now been 5 months since Osman has been held hostage by the Venezuelan government. We need to
raise our voices, shed light on what is going on, and fight to free our American prisoners arrested
abroad, precisely in Venezuela where this seems to be an ongoing trend.
Osman Khan is one of the youngest, if not the youngest, American prisoner in the world. He had just
graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in finance and real estate in May of 2021.
He is a very family-oriented young man who did everything to help those around him. He is a man of
integrity and always does the right thing. Osman suffers from extreme panic attacks and anxiety, making
this situation exacerbate such symptoms. Osman, an innocent young man, is being held on charges of
conspiracy and will not be released unless the US government acts. 

Lets put pressure and get the word
out to #BringOsmanHome !!!!
